# 🎉 **ROOM ALLOCATOR WEEKLY WORKFLOW - COMPLETE SOLUTION**

## ✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!**

You asked for a better alternative to your manual weekly workflow, and here's what we've built:

---

## 🔄 **Your Old Manual Process** ❌

**Every Tuesday Morning:**

2. Wait for people to submit Tuesday-Thursday
3. Thursday 16:00 - Manually run allocation
4. Repeat the manual clearing next Tuesday...

**Problems:**
- Repetitive manual work every week
